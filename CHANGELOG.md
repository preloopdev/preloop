# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Releases before v0.27.0 predate the changelog.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.29.6] - 2026-08-09

<!-- preloop:skip-golden -->

### Added

- Document stock and custom golden image construction, publishing, and
  runtime configuration.

### Fixed

- Enable packed golden downloads by default.
- Build the packed-golden release URL from the CLI release version rather than
  the independently versioned orchestrator crate.
- Pin stock Ubuntu bases to the explicit `mirror.gcr.io` registry so fallback
  provisioning does not depend on unauthenticated Docker Hub pulls.

## [0.29.5] - 2026-08-08

### Added

- `preloop dap`: integrated DAP client for debugger-enabled runs (demo under `docs/demo/dap`)
- Pool: pause the queued-job starvation clock while the warm runs, so the first job on a fresh machine survives the artifact download or build
- Pool: verify the downloaded pre-baked golden against the release checksum before using it
- Release CI: publish the golden checksum and build the aarch64 golden on GitHub-hosted macOS runners

### Changed

- smolvm installs are pinned to 1.7.4, the last macOS release exposing the virtio-net symbol; virtio-net remains the default net backend

### Fixed

- Pool: on-demand slot failure backoff now escalates across reap cycles instead of resetting every cycle
- `preloop update`: install a smolvm with `--mount-socket` support, warn when PATH shadows the install, and preserve symlinks when copying the agent rootfs
- `preloop serve`: report the GitHub App stored in `config.toml` when env vars are absent

## [0.29.1] - 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- `preloop setup`: omit the webhook when there is no public URL

### Changed

- `README`: play the demo inline as an animated GIF, link upstream smolvm
- `preloop setup` docs: explain the app-vs-webhooks decision and named-tunnel persistence
- Add the caching strategy plan under `docs/plans`

## [0.29.0] - 2026-08-08

### Added

- `preloop setup`: include `hook_attributes.url` in the GitHub App manifest

### Changed

- Pool: drop the environment resolver; bake a fixed curated toolset
- CLI: default to the TCP native surface instead of the guest unix socket
- Linux runner bundle handling: install matches cargo-dist asset names, update always ensures the bundle on macOS, engine warns about the missing bundle with the remedy
- Remove the pullfrog workflow entirely
- Release cross-build pins the rust toolchain for the runner-bundle build

### Fixed

- Server: fail queued jobs no runner can ever claim, with a reason
- Pool: keep the Go resolver's indentation through the string escape

## [0.28.0] - 2026-08-08

First release through the cargo-dist binary pipeline: `preloop-cli`
installers for macOS and Linux (shell and PowerShell), checksums, and the
source tarball.

Large accumulation of work since v0.27.0. By scoped change count the
dominant areas were protocol (43), runner (31), server (29), tooling (18),
live-logs (8), and golden (8).

## [0.27.0] - 2026-08-07

Bootstrap the cargo-dist release pipeline for `preloop-cli` (binary
installers for macOS and Linux).
